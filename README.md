# Identity Access and Management: Coffee Shop

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. The purpose of this project is to help them set up their menu experience.

This is a full stack drink menu application that:

Displays graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
Allows public users to view drink names and graphics.
Allows the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
Allows the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
complete the required endpoints, configure, and integrate Auth0 for authentication.

### Backend
View the [Backend README](./backend/README.md) for more details.

### Frontend
The [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md) directory contains a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will only need to update the environment variables found within (./frontend/src/environment/environment.ts) to reflect the Auth0 configuration details set up for the backend app.
